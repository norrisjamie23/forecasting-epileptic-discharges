# Interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) forecasting

This is the repository for my MRes Dissertation at UCL titled '*Spatiotemporal clustering and forecasting of interictal epileptiform discharges using a convolutional neural network*'. This repository is currently a work in progress, but  will include scripts to detect IEDs from SEEG data to produce a labelled dataset and machine learning classifiers to forecast short-term IED likelihood.
